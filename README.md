* Go to ComfyUI manager -> install with URL -> add the URL of this page.

## How to use...


* Don't block the output / input areas.
* Give it some room.  If the connections have no room to move, it'll get confused.
* Don't make the connections go backwards before going towards it's destination.
* There is no insert dot in the middle of the connection.  Drag the output to an empty spot, add a new node, and drag the output of the new node.  Sorry.
* Can be disabled in options under "Quick connections", "Circuit Board lines"


## Can be used with litegraph too.  See example
